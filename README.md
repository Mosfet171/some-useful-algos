# Some Useful Algorithms

In this repo I grouped some common useful algorithms for problem solving. They are based on examples (mostly from LeetCode) but can of course be easily adapted to similar problems. These include:

1. Basic DP approaches:
	- Recusrion
	- Top-Down DP (w/ Memoization)
	- Bottom-Up DP (w/ Tabulation)
	- Space-Optimized DP
2. X-Common-Something:
	- Longest Common Subsequence/Substring
	- Shortest Common Supersequence/Substring
	- Suffix Arrays / Suffix Trees
3. Binary Searches
4. Sliding Windows
5. 2-Pointer Techniques
6. Difference Arrays
7. Directed Graph Techniques
	- Kahn's Algorithm
	- Topological Sorting
8. Graph Algorithms
	- Dijkstra's
	- A/A*
9. Disjoint Union Set
10. Bit manipulation techniques 
11. Prime Checking 
	- Sieve of Erathostenes
12. Some In-Place Algorithms
