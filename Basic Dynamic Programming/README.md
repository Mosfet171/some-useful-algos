# Basic Dynamic Programming Approaches

We build different algorithms to return the nth Fibonnaci number and compare them.
- Recursive Function
- Recursive with built-in Python Cache decorator
- Recursive with custom memoization table ("Fake" Top-Down DP)
- Bottom-Up DP with Complete Tabulation 
- Bottom-Up DP with Space Optimization.

## Time Taken
We ask for the 1000th Fib number and average the time taken by each approach on 100 runs.
