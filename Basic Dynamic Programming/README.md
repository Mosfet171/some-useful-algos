# Basic Dynamic Programming Approaches

We build different algorithms to return the nth Fibonnaci number and compare them.
- Recursive Function
- Recursive with built-in Python Cache decorator
- Recursive with custom memoization table ("Fake" Top-Down DP)
- Bottom-Up DP with Complete Tabulation 
- Bottom-Up DP with Space Optimization.

## How To Run 
Simply run `python3 fib.py` to see the results.

## Time Taken
We ask for the 20th Fib number and average the time taken by each approach on 500 runs.
We see an absolutely enormous perfomance improvement for any other approach than pure recursion. The best one by far is the built-in cache decorator though.
